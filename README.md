🚀 Project Update: AWS-Powered Exponentiation App 🚀

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, an application that calculates the result of any base raised to a given exponent, powered by AWS services!

🔹 Tech Stack & AWS Services Used:

🗄️ AWS Amplify: For frontend deployment, providing a seamless user experience.
 🧮 AWS Lambda: Serverless backend function to handle the calculation logic efficiently.
 🌐 Amazon API Gateway : To route and manage requests from the frontend to the backend.
🔐 AWS IAM : Ensuring secure access and permissions across AWS resources.
⚡ Amazon DynamoDB: Storing calculation history for quick retrieval and analytics.

This project gave me hands-on experience integrating these powerful AWS tools to build a responsive and scalable app. 💡
